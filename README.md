Using a venv isn't obligatory, it's just convenient

Using the venv (linux)

activate the venv
``` shell
$ source bin/activate
```
and 
``` shell
$ deactivate
```
to exit

Using the venv (windows)

Make a venv in a folder and add it to .gitignore, works the same as on linux 

## TODO

save users on database and check for already existing user with the same email
